# LED Lighting scripts

## Introduction

The scripts are written in python and use Neopixel library to light up the pixels

youâ€™ll also need to import the Mysql Connector library for database handling

`sudo pip3 install rpi_ws281x adafruit-circuitpython-neopixel`

`sudo python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall adafruit-blinka`

`sudo python3 -m pip install mysql-connector-python`

## Main Script

### Display

This script (`Main.py`) update pixels status in a loop, every iteration of the loop is basically a tick.
We made light profiles to update the pixels along a certain pattern.

We call the `Profile.display()` method every tick to update pixels, for further explanation on how those profiles work refer to the **OOP** section.

### Profiles Handling

The current profile type and options is taken from a json file

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Note: We use a json file so thereâ€™s close to no delay to retrieve data instead of querying the database every tick. However this means the json has to be updated outside of the main script.

</aside>

Using the name of the profile we create a new profile instance:
`profile = Factory(name)(args)`

### Database Handling

We retrieve the data we want in a separate script : `writetojson.py`

using our database credentials stored in `config.py`
