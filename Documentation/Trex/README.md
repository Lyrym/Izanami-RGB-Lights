# Izanami - 伊邪那美

## Trex Game Documentation

### This documentation will help you setup the Trex Game
> You need to start the script config.sh before doing the next steps

### How to set up

For the Trex Game you need the ``dotnet.core``

Launch your game by doing these 3 steps :

- Go to the right path ``cd ./Izanami/Trex``
- Launch the game ``dotnet run``
- Have fun with your leds

### How it works

1) Your led will be doing a wave everytime your score increase.
2) All multiples of 5 will change the color of your led.
3) If you die, the led will switch to red with a breathing effect until you restart the game with ``R``
