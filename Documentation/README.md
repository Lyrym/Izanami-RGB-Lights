## How Be a RGB Gamer

- First of all, you need to create your MySQL Database, the [MySql Documentation](https://github.com/x33lyS/Izanami/tree/main/Documentation/Database) will help you
    - > A script will be add later for easy configuration ( with leds profiles updated)
- After, you need to launch the ``config.sh`` file with your database data.
    - > This will setup all the config files for all games / project
- Send the directory ``RasbperryPi`` in your raspberry
    - > You will run the file for the leds inside your Raspberry
- Connect the leds to your Raspberry
    - > Follow the [Raspberry Documentation](https://github.com/x33lyS/Izanami/tree/main/Documentation/Raspberry) instructions
- Now you can run the ``run.sh`` in your Raspberry
    - > For that just go in your raspberry terminal and do a ``sudo bash ./RaspBerryPi/RGB_Script/run.sh``
