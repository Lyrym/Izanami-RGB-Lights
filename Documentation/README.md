## How To Be a RGB Gamer

- First of all, you need to create a MySQL Database, the [MySql Documentation](https://github.com/x33lyS/Izanami/tree/main/Documentation/Database) will help you
    - A script will be added later for easy configuration ( with leds profiles updated)
- Then you need to launch the `config.sh` file with your database data.
    - This will setup all the config files for all games / project
- Send the directory `RasbperryPi` in your raspberry via FTP
    - You will run the script for the leds inside your Raspberry
- Connect the leds to your Raspberry
    - Follow the [Raspberry Documentation](https://github.com/x33lyS/Izanami/tree/main/Documentation/Raspberry) instructions
- Now you can launch the `run.sh` in your Raspberry
    - To do that just go in your raspberry terminal and write `sudo bash ./RaspberryPi/RGB_Script/run.sh`
