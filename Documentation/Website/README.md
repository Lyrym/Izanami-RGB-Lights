## Website Documentation

### This documentation will help you setup the Website
> You need to start the script config.sh before doing next steps

For the website setup you need only two steps :

- Put your website online with a domain name
- In the ``action.php`` line `7` change the ``config.php`` path 
> Warning if you put the config.php file in the domain name path or after, all of your database configuration will be public.
> Try to move it in the path we make ( the file will work, and it will be inaccessible for unwanted visitors)
- Now you can change the color of your light on your website

### Next update -We Are Working On It -

- A new update can be incorporated by adding the actual color of your leds on the website
- A list of profile RGB color will be added to have more opportunity and fun with your leds
