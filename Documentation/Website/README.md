## Website Documentation

### This documentation will help you setup the Website
> You need to start the script config.sh before doing next steps

For the website setup only two steps :

- Put your website online on a domain name
- Change the ``config.php`` path to work in the ``action.php`` line `7`
> Attention if you put the config.php file in the domain name path or after, all of your database configuration will be public.
> Try to move it in the path we make ( the file will work, and it will be inaccessible for other person)
- Now you can change the color of your light on your website
